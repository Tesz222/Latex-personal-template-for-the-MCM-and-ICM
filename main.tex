    \textbf{For Problem 1}, the objective is to classify underwater images based on degradation characteristics using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). Firstly, the collected data undergoes preprocessing, including image resizing, normalization, and data augmentation. Then, ResNet50 is used as the backbone, combined with a color attention module and a blur detection module to enhance feature extraction. Next, the extracted features are fused through an integration module to generate comprehensive representations. Finally, the fused features are classified into categories such as color shift;low illumination;blur or clear and the results are recorded in an Excel file.
    \textbf{For Problem 2}, the objective is to classify underwater images based on degradation. 
    \textbf{For Problem 3}, the objective is to classify underwater images based on degradation. 
    \textbf{For Problem 4}, the objective is to classify underwater images based on degradation.
    In conclusion, this study establishes a deep learning framework for underwater image enhancement, demonstrating its effectiveness and providing insights for future applications.

\subsubsection{Model extension}

这里写模型的改进，如下面案例所示。

Under the deep learning framework, in order to further solve the problem of complex underwater image degradation and expand the application scenarios of the model, optimization and promotion can be carried out from the following aspects:

\textbf{First, introduce physically-guided deep learning models. }
Combined with underwater physical properties (such as multipath scattering of light, distribution of suspended particles, etc.), physical constraints or physical Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are incorporated into the network. For example, by constructing a self-supervised or weakly supervised learning framework combining the optical scattering law, the model can more accurately simulate the degradation characteristics of turbidity water and deep-sea low-light environment during the learning process.

\subsubsection{Model application}

这里写模型的应用

High-quality visual data is essential for deeper ocean exploration and efficient utilization of underwater resources. The rapid development of deep learning has led to the emergence of underwater image enhancement models, offering effective solutions to challenges posed by complex underwater environments. Enhanced images significantly improve the visual perception capabilities of underwater robots, such as Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) and Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs), enabling more accurate target recognition, path planning, and obstacle avoidance in complex scenarios. Coupled with lightweight network structures, these models meet real-time processing demands, advancing underwater automation systems. Additionally, deep learning-based enhancement models play a critical role in marine environmental monitoring and disaster assessment, especially in turbid water conditions, by enhancing degraded images with physically guided methods. This ensures better data quality for disaster response and environmental analysis. With continued research and innovation, underwater image enhancement through deep learning promises broader applications and significant contributions to underwater exploration and related fields.

\section{Conclusions}

这里写本文解决方案的总结，这个章节是美赛特色，必须要写上

This study leverages deep learning techniques to systematically address underwater image degradation classification and enhancement problems, proposing efficient convolutional neural network classification models and generative adversarial network-based enhancement frameworks to effectively handle multiple degradation types. For degradation classification, a ResNet-50 backbone combined with color attention and blur detection modules achieves high-accuracy classification of color shift, low illumination, and blur, providing reliable data for subsequent enhancement tasks. In degradation modeling, the GAN framework employs a generator to simulate underwater optical degradation effects and a discriminator to ensure the realism of generated images, creating diverse degradation scenarios critical for enhancement model training. For single enhancement tasks, tailored modules for color correction, brightness enhancement, and clarity restoration effectively address color distortion, insufficient brightness, and image blurring, achieving targeted quality improvements. In multi-degradation scenarios, a multi-task learning-based composite enhancement model is developed, integrating specialized task branches and employing attention mechanisms for effective feature fusion, enabling coordinated optimization of complex degradation types. Experimental results demonstrate that single enhancement techniques are highly efficient in specific degradation scenarios, while composite enhancement techniques exhibit superior overall performance in complex settings. This work provides a comprehensive deep learning solution for underwater image processing, laying a solid foundation for multi-scenario applications and future advancements.

\subsection{分点讨论引用实例}
\subsubsection{分点方案1}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Adopt Comprehensive Models:} For real-world applications with multiple overlapping degradation types, comprehensive enhancement models should be prioritized. These models excel in addressing multifaceted degradation challenges, offering a more reliable and holistic solution compared to single-degradation approaches.
    \item \textbf{Refine Model Parameters:} Continuous refinement of the comprehensive model's parameters is essential to enhance its performance in varied environments. Adjusting factors like the relative contributions of color correction, brightness improvement, and sharpness enhancement can optimize results for specific degradation patterns.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{分点方案2}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Powerful feature extraction capabilities:} Deep learning models can automatically extract features from images and adapt to complex underwater scenes. By training with large amounts of data, it is possible to learn degenerate patterns such as blur, color distortion, and low light.
Modern architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNS) can process underwater images with various degrees of degradation and have strong scene adaptability.
\item \textbf{data-driven optimization:} With the introduction of more diverse data, the model can be gradually improved, even to accommodate rare degradation scenarios.
\end{itemize}
